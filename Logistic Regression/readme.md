Logistic regression is named for the function used at the core of the method, the logistic function.
 Logistic regression uses an equation as the representation, very much like linear regression.
 Input values (X) are combined linearly using weights or coefficient values to predict an output value (y).
  A key difference from linear regression is that the output value being modeled is a binary value (0 or 1) rather than a numeric value.
