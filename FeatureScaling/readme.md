Feature Scaling / Data Normalization ( / gaussian distribution)

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26225344/why-feature-scaling

As the cost function may take more time to converge to global minimum (Gradient descent), in case of parameters taking large values compared to other parameters. We need to apply Feature Scaling.
